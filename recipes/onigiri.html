        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Stuffed with a variety of fillings and flavors, these rice balls make an ideal quick snack and are a fun alternative to sandwiches for lunch. In this recipe, you’ll learn how to make onigiri (musubi) using the common ingredients for rice balls in Japan.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>Kosher/Sea Salt</li>
            <li>4 sheets nori, cut into halves or thirds</li>
            <li>Filling of choice (salted salmon, okaka, tuna mayo, umeboshi, seasoned kombu</li>
            <li>Toasted Sesame Seeds to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, wet both of your hands with water in order to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.</li>
            <li>Then put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around your palms. How much salt? I dip 3 finger tips in kosher salt shown in the picture below. If you are using table salt, use half amount as it’s saltier than kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Scoop out a handful of warm rice (about ⅓ cup) into one hand. Create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 tsp) inside. Then mold the rice with your hands around the well to cover your filling completely.</li>
            <li>Press the rice around the filling to gently form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to make a triangle corner. Your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn’t fall apart. You don’t want to squeeze the rice too tight.</li>
            <li>Wrap the onigiri with nori seaweed.</li>
            <li>Place a little bit of each filling on top of onigiri so we know which kind it is. </li>
        </ol>
